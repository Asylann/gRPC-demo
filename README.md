# My first experience with gRPC tool in Golang!
*** 
## At this stage i will commit what i have learned!
***
## Structure:
 
### /client folder: this for client side that will communicate with server side and call necessary method with gRPC tool! (maybe it will be on Python or other PLs, idk yet)

### /server folder: this for server side that will communicate with client side and process all data and methods with gRPC tool!


### /proto folder: it will contain proto file that will be shared between server and client side!

### I think for the start it enough.

#### I am sure that i will change some details and other things.
#### So, if i change the structure, i will announce it!
